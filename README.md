# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

## Prerequisites`

To get started with the application, you need to have Git, Node.js, and npm installed on your machine.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Install and run application

Clone the repository: https://github.com/The-algar/Clermontet_Eric_P14_23012023
Navigate to the cloned repository.
Run npm install to install dependencies.

### Install back-end

This project uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for database management

Create a new Firebase project and start a new collection named 'employees' before launching the application.
Copy the firebaseConfig constant from your Firebase project settings.
Create a .env file at the project root with the environment variable names and your firebaseConfig values. Don't forget to add the .env file to .gitignore.
Run npm start. The application will run in development mode at http://localhost:3000. see details below.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

### Install and Launch the Application

- [ ] Clone the repository: https://github.com/The-algar/Clermontet_Eric_P14_23012023
- [ ] Navigate to the cloned repository with `cd Clermontet_Eric_P14_23012023`
- [ ] Run npm install to install dependencies.
- [ ] Run npm start. The application will run in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
